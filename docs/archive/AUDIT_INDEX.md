## 📞 Common Questions

### Q: How bad is it?
**A**: Code is good, but doesn't match spec. 4 hours of work to fix.

### Q: What's the biggest issue?
**A**: Missing `startEarning()` and `stopEarning()` functions - critical requirement.

### Q: Can we ship this?
**A**: No, not until critical fixes are applied and testnet deployment completed.

### Q: How long to fix?
**A**: 3-4 hours for code fixes, 1 hour for testnet deployment.

### Q: Is the code secure?
**A**: Mostly yes, but constructor guard is disabled (2 minute fix).

### Q: Are tests good?
**A**: Excellent - 29 tests, all passing. Need to add 5 more for new functions.

### Q: Will fixes break things?
**A**: No, mostly renaming. New functions are additive. Tests will catch any issues.

### Q: What after fixes?
**A**: Deploy to testnet, verify transactions, update docs, resubmit.

## 🎓 Learning Points

This audit revealed common pitfalls:

1. **Read specs literally** - Spec says `pullAndDistributeYield`, must use exact name
2. **Don't add extras** - Spec says "minimal", but implementation added freeze/unfreeze
3. **Test against spec** - Good tests, but didn't verify spec compliance
4. **Deploy early** - Testnet deployment should happen during development
5. **Match signatures** - `initialize()` signature must match spec exactly

---

## 💡 Tips for Success

### For Current Fixes
- Use find/replace for renaming (see QUICK_FIX_GUIDE)
- Fix one priority level at a time
- Test after each major change
- Don't skip the constructor guard fix

### For Future Projects
- Create spec compliance checklist early
- Match naming exactly from the start
- Deploy to testnet during development
- Keep it minimal unless spec says otherwise
- Test against specification, not just functionality
